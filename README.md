## 1. Introduction

Anyone who has followed this team throughout the season will agree that it has been a particularly challenging one. For those who did not...

According to [Odds to Make the 2024-2025 NBA Playoffs](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-win/?y=2024-2025&sa=nba&t=post&o=mk) by Sports Odd History, the Los Angeles Clippers were ranked as the 12th team in the Western Conference in terms of postseason chances, before the start of the season. They [lost key players from their 2023‚Äì2024 roster](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/paul-george-breaks-silence-on-leaving-clippers-for-76ers-01j2723fea3v#:~:text=Paul%20George%20shocked%20the%20NBA,silence%20in%20a%20press%20release.), and their highest-paid player, Kawhi Leonard, [was sidelined for most of the early part of the season](https://www.nba.com/news/kawhi-leonard-season-debut). Most sports analysts weren‚Äôt giving them much of a chance to enter the PlayOffs.

However, by the time they entered their 72nd game of the season, they held a 40-31 record‚Äîjust half a game away from securing the 6th seed and earning a direct Playoff spot, avoiding the Play-In tournament.

So, how did this team exceed early expectations? How did they defy the odds? What insights can help us understand their performance? Was their success consistent or marked by irregularities? Let‚Äôs find out.

We will analyze the Clippers‚Äô game data in an effort to understand and address these questions.

### 1.1 Overview of the project

This project consisted in first, download the data

### 1.2 Project Goals

The goal that we set before starting the analysis, was to try to find any significal factors that could explain Clippers' victories and their defeats. Ideally it would be fun to find some insights Our data is limited, but data is magic.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset utilized in this analysis was sourced from the [Official NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats) website using the [`nba_api` by @swar](https://github.com/swar/nba_api).

To assess the performance of the LA Clippers, we extracted the game results for the 2024‚Äì2025 Regular Season. The original dataset included the following fields:

`'SEASON_ID', 'TEAM_ID', 'TEAM_ABBREVIATION', 'TEAM_NAME', 'GAME_ID',  
 'GAME_DATE', 'MATCHUP', 'WL', 'MIN', 'PTS', 'FGM', 'FGA', 'FG_PCT',  
 'FG3M', 'FG3A', 'FG3_PCT', 'FTM', 'FTA', 'FT_PCT', 'OREB', 'DREB',  
 'REB', 'AST', 'STL', 'BLK', 'TOV', 'PF', 'PLUS_MINUS'`

All statistical data (e.g., `PTS`, `FGM`, etc.) refers specifically to the LA Clippers.

For the purposes of our analysis, the dataset was reduced to retain only the following columns:

`'TEAM_ID', 'TEAM_ABBREVIATION', 'TEAM_NAME', 'GAME_ID', 'GAME_DATE', 'MATCHUP', 'WL', 'PTS', 'PLUS_MINUS'`.

Descriptions of the retained fields are as follows:

- `TEAM_ID`: Unique identifier for the LA Clippers (`1610612746`).
- `TEAM_ABBREVIATION`: Team abbreviation (`LAC`).
- `TEAM_NAME`: Team name (`LA Clippers`).
- `GAME_ID`: Unique identifier for each game.
- `GAME_DATE`: Date of the game in `yyyy-mm-dd` format (`str`).
- `MATCHUP`: Game matchup information (e.g., `LAC @ NYK`).
- `WL`: Game outcome (`W` for win, `L` for loss).
- `PTS`: Total points scored by the Clippers. \*later renamed as `LAC_PTS`.
- `PLUS_MINUS`: Point differential between the Clippers and their opponent.

For future procedures we built new columns:

- `OPP_PTS`: Total points scored by the opponents of the Clippers.
- `OPT_TEAM_ABBREVIATION`: Abbreviation of the oponent team (e.g., `NYK`).
- `HA`: Court advantage (`H` for home games, `A` for away games).

Then, using our GamesDF we extracted the plays for each game using the `GAME_ID`.
