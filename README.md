## 1. Introduction
Anyone who has followed this team throughout the season will agree that it has been a particularly challenging one. For those who did not...  

According to [Odds to Make the 2024-2025 NBA Playoffs](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-win/?y=2024-2025&sa=nba&t=post&o=mk) by Sports Odd History, the Los Angeles Clippers were ranked as the 12th team in the Western Conference in terms of postseason chances, before the start of the season. They [lost key players from their 2023‚Äì2024 roster](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/paul-george-breaks-silence-on-leaving-clippers-for-76ers-01j2723fea3v#:~:text=Paul%20George%20shocked%20the%20NBA,silence%20in%20a%20press%20release.), and their highest-paid player, Kawhi Leonard, [was sidelined for most of the early part of the season](https://www.nba.com/news/kawhi-leonard-season-debut). Most sports analysts weren‚Äôt giving them much of a chance to enter the PlayOffs. 

However, by the time they entered their 72nd game of the season, they held a 40-31 record‚Äîjust half a game away from securing the 6th seed and earning a direct Playoff spot, avoiding the Play-In tournament.

We will analyze the Clippers‚Äô game data in an effort to understand and address these questions.
